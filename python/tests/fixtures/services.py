"""Service Fixtures for Tests.

This module is reserved for infrastructure service fixtures.
Capability-specific fixtures (e.g., SessionStateService) belong in
the capability layer's own conftest.py.

Constitutional Import Boundary Note:
- Airframe tests must NOT import from capability layers
- Capability-specific fixtures belong in jeeves-capability-*/conftest.py
