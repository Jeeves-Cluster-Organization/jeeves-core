"""WebSocket client management and event subscription.

Constitutional Pattern:
- WebSocket handler subscribes to gateway_events
- Routers publish events, don't know about WebSocket
- This module bridges events to WebSocket clients

UNIFIED EVENT SUPPORT (2025-12-14):
- Now receives Event instances from gateway_events
- Converts to JSON format for WebSocket transmission
- Constitutional compliance with EventEmitterProtocol

Usage:
    # In main.py at startup
    from avionics.gateway.websocket import setup_websocket_subscriptions
    setup_websocket_subscriptions()
