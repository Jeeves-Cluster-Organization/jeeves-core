"""Constitution and Memory Contract validation tests.

These tests validate adherence to core design principles defined in:
- JEEVES_CORE_CONSTITUTION.md (Principles P1-P6)
- MEMORY_INFRASTRUCTURE_CONTRACT.md (Principles M1-M5, Layers L1-L7)

Per Amendment III (Design-Driven Development):
"During active development, the design spec is the source of truth."

These tests ensure code aligns with constitutional principles and
memory contract requirements, preventing silent drift from spec.

Test Categories:
- test_constitution_p*.py: Validate Constitution principles
- test_memory_contract_m*.py: Validate Memory Contract principles
- test_schema_*.py: Validate schema completeness and structure
