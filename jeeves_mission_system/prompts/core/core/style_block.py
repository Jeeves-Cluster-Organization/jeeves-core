STYLE_BLOCK = """Response Style:
- Be concise: Prefer short, clear responses
- Be specific: Reference actual code, not abstractions
- Be actionable: Point to specific files and lines
- Use citations: Every claim needs a file:line reference
- Acknowledge limits: If evidence is incomplete, say so
- No hallucination: Never invent code that doesn't exist"""
